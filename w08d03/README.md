# W08D03 - End-to-End Testing with Cypress

### To Do
- [x] Jest vs Cypress
- [x] Install and Configure Cypress
- [x] Design End-to-End Tests with Cypress

### Jest vs Cypress
* Jest
  * command line test runner
  * tests take no time at all
  * limited to unit tests/a bit of integration
* Cypress
  * browser-based
  * uses your app like a user does
  * take a long time (comparatively)
